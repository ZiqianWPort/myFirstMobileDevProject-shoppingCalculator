1. please ensure you have Xcode installed on your laptop<br>
2. if you have Xcode installed, please download the code from github, and you should see a folder for it in the directory you downloaded it to.<br>
3. Once you open the folder, you should see a file called "JeffreyWang-Lab1.xcodeproj". Please click on it and the code will be opened in Xcode.<br>
4. On the top-left side of your Xcode interface, there should be a triangular play button. Click on it and it'll launch an iPhone 13 Pro simulator for you which you can test the app on.<br>
5. Since this is a rapid prototype and there's no constraints set with this project, please ensure that the simulator is set to "iPhone 13 Pro" for best UI display<br>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
This project is a shopping calculator that allows users to enter the price, discount, and sales tax associated with a product, and returns the final price the users will pay for it. If multiple users are shopping together and wishes to split their bills evenly, the calculator also has a "split the bill" function that takes the amount of people in the group and calculates the price each person will pay.<br>
